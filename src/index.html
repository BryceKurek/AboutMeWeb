                    Let me take a moment to thank you for taking a look at my work, 
                    I hope that at the very least you enjoy your time here. My name is
                    Bryce Kurek and every one of these projects required me to learn something new
                    including this very website.

                    to a list of my projects, and my contact information. To the left of where you are reading contains
                    links to the specific GitHub repository for that Project.
